# 📄 Compliance Report  
**Privacy-by-Design Analytics Pipeline**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project demonstrates a privacy-aware approach to user data analytics, 
designed with *Privacy by Design* principles from the ground up. It 
simulates essential controls to handle data responsibly and supports 
compliance with global privacy laws like **GDPR** and **CCPA**.

---

## 🔐 Privacy Controls Implemented

### ✅ Data Minimization
- Collected only essential personal data: full name, email, phone, 
address, date of birth.
- Full date of birth was removed — only the **year** is retained to reduce 
re-identification risk.

### ✅ Pseudonymization
- Used **SHA-256 hashing** to anonymize sensitive fields (full name, 
email, phone number, address).
- Ensures that even if data is exposed, personal identities are not 
revealed.

### ✅ Differential Privacy (Noise Injection)
- Introduced random variation (±1 year) to `year_of_birth` field.
- This technique adds uncertainty and reduces the risk of guessing 
someone’s identity based on age.
- Demonstrates understanding of statistical privacy protections.

### ✅ Audit Logging
- Every action is timestamped and written to a centralized log 
(`audit_log.txt`).
- Tracks data creation, anonymization, and transformation steps.
- Enables accountability and supports future audit/compliance reviews.

### ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Simulated access control based on user role:
  - **Admin:** Views raw, unmasked data
  - **Analyst:** Views anonymized, noise-injected data only
- Demonstrates basic separation of privileges and the principle of least 
access.

## ⚖️ Regulatory Alignment

| Regulation | Principle / Clause                          | 
Implementation Example                          |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **GDPR**   | Article 5(1)(c): Data Minimization           | Reduced DOB 
to year only                        |
|            | Article 32: Integrity & Confidentiality     | Hashing + 
RBAC simulation                       |
| **CCPA**   | §1798.105: Right to Delete / De-Identify     | 
Anonymization pipeline using SHA-256            |
|            | §1798.140: Security Procedures & Practices  | Audit logging 
and access role separation        |

## 📌 Summary

This pipeline demonstrates how privacy engineering principles can be 
applied in practice — not just as a checklist, but as design decisions. 
Through **minimization**, **pseudonymization**, **differential privacy**, 
and **access control**, this project shows how to build trust and mitigate 
data risk.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Add real user authentication and dynamic role-based access
- Include consent management and lifecycle control
- Conduct re-identification risk assessments
- Integrate a live dashboard for privacy compliance tracking
