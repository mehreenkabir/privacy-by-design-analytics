# Privacy-by-Design Analytics Pipeline

This project simulates how a privacy-conscious team might collect and 
analyze personal data while minimizing risk and aligning with global 
privacy standards like GDPR and CCPA.

The goal is to demonstrate Privacy by Design — not just as a theory, but 
through practical steps: anonymization, minimization, differential 
privacy, audit logging, and access control.

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Data Minimization: Dropping unnecessary fields like full date of birth.
- Pseudonymization: Using SHA-256 to hash all identifiable fields.
- Differential Privacy: Adding noise to sensitive fields to prevent 
re-identification.
- Audit Logging: Tracking every processing step for accountability.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Simulated roles to separate access 
privileges.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Generate fake personal data:
    ```bash
    python scripts/data_collection.py
    ```

3. Anonymize sensitive fields:
    ```bash
    python scripts/data_anonymization.py
    ```

4. Add noise for differential privacy:
    ```bash
    python scripts/differential_privacy.py
    ```

5. Simulate role-based access:
    ```bash
    python scripts/access_control.py
    ```

## Sample Use Cases

- Privacy engineering interviews and demonstrations.
- Compliance walkthroughs to show de-identification strategies.
- Internal training examples for building privacy-aware pipelines.

## About This Project

This pipeline was developed as a hands-on demonstration of privacy 
engineering best practices. It is intended to show how to design for data 
protection from the start, using scalable and auditable techniques. It is 
not intended for production use but as a concept-level showcase of 
privacy-first architecture.
