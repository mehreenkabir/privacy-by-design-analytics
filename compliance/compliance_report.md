# Compliance Report  
Privacy-by-Design Analytics Pipeline

---

## Purpose

This project demonstrates a privacy-aware approach to user data analytics, designed with Privacy by Design principles from the ground up. It simulates essential controls to handle data responsibly and supports compliance with global privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA.

---

## Privacy Controls Implemented

### Data Minimization
- Collected only essential personal data: full name, email, phone number, address, and date of birth.
- Full date of birth was removed — only the year is retained to reduce re-identification risk.

### Pseudonymization
- Used SHA-256 hashing to anonymize sensitive fields (full name, email, phone number, and address).
- Ensures that even if data is exposed, personal identities are not revealed.

### Differential Privacy (Noise Injection)
- Introduced random variation (±1 year) to the `year_of_birth` field.
- Adds uncertainty to prevent guessing someone’s identity based on exact age.
- Demonstrates application of statistical privacy protections.

### Audit Logging
- Each action (data generation, anonymization, noise injection) is timestamped and recorded in `audit_log.txt`.
- Provides traceability and accountability for data-handling processes.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Simulated role-based access control system:
  - Admins can view full raw data.
  - Analysts can only view anonymized and noise-injected data.
- Demonstrates basic access separation and least-privilege principle.

## Regulatory Alignment

| Regulation | Principle / Clause                          | Implementation Example                                |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| GDPR       | Article 5(1)(c): Data Minimization           | Reduced date of birth to year only                     |
|            | Article 32: Integrity & Confidentiality      | Hashing, pseudonymization, and access control          |
| CCPA       | §1798.105: Right to Delete / De-Identify     | SHA-256 anonymization pipeline                         |
|            | §1798.140: Security Procedures & Practices   | Audit logging and role-based data access separation    |

## Summary

This pipeline is a practical demonstration of privacy engineering principles in action. Rather than being a compliance checklist, the design decisions made in this project prioritize minimizing data exposure, preventing identity linkage, and enabling clear audit trails. The implementation includes real techniques such as pseudonymization, statistical noise injection, and role-aware access patterns.

## Future Enhancements

- Add user authentication and dynamic RBAC enforcement
- Integrate consent management and data retention controls
- Conduct formal re-identification risk assessments
- Build a compliance dashboard for monitoring and reporting
